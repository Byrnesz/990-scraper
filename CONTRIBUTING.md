# Contributing to the 990 Scraper a.k.a. Nonprofit Info Collector

Thanks for helping to build the 990 Scraper a.k.a. Nonprofit Info Collector!

This project is a way to quickly and easily aggregate information on a bunch of nonprofits, all in one easy to navigate, and easy to visualize (if you so choose) place. The tool is going to be used to gather information on organizations that make, use, or engage with technology for social justice (as found in [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jwM-cYI1Ep9ZjNxGDjJXjqNkYA-f1ViyAH-Bv1tLvV4/edit#gid=0)), but could be used on any list of United States Nonprofits you have. 

These are some guidelines on how you can help.
