## What's in a 990?
Nonprofit corporations in the United States have to submit one of a few types of tax forms to the IRS each year, which are then made public. If their total revenue is over $200,000 in a year, they submit a [form 990](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f990.pdf), if it is between $50,000 and $199,999, they submit a [form 990-ez](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f990ez.pdf), and if it is under $50,000, they submit a [990-N (e-postcard)](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/annual-electronic-notice-form-990-n-for-small-organizations-what-to-report). The information obtained from these forms from 2011-2014 is what has been made available through the ProPublica Nonprofit Explorer API.
